V(E) Cover: choose some V(E) to cover all E(V)
V(E) Independ: set of V(E) not adj to each other

M = Max Matching
Cv = Min V Cover
Ce = Min E Cover
Iv = Max V Ind
Ie = Max E Ind (equiv to M)

M = Cv (Konig Theorem)
Iv = V \ Cv
Ce = V - M

Construct Cv:
1. Run Dinic
2. Find s-t min cut
3. Cv = {X in T} + {Y in S}
